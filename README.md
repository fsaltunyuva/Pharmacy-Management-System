### Important Note
The database contents and the table's structure are not stated but can be retrieved from the codes themselves or can be changed in codes to fit another database structure.

Before connecting the application to the database, the MSSQL's JDBC jar file must be extracted and the credentials of the Config.java in the Helper package must be written according to the database that will be connected.
